# Linux Malware 

## Persistence

Malwares could use the following techniques for achieving persistence on infected system.

### Subsystem Initialization

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Init): 

> In Unix-based computer operating systems, init (short for initialization) is the first process started during booting of the computer system. Init is a daemon process that continues running until the system is shut down.

Manipulating one of the following paths should result with malware persistence:

- `/etc/rc.d/rc.local`
- `/etc/rc.conf`
- `/etc/init.d/`
- `/etc/rcX.d/`
- `/etc/rc.local`
- `systemd` service
- `~/.bashrc`
- `~/.bash_profile`
- *X* desktop autostart

*Most of the listed locations required root privileges for modification.*

### Time-based Execution

Linux equivalent to Windows's Task Scheduler. Malwares with the right privileges will be able to register a `cron` job which will execute the malware according to the job configuration.

Related paths:

- `/etc/cron.hourly/`
- `/etc/crontab`
- `/etc/cron.daily/`
